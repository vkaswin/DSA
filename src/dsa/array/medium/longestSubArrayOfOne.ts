/*

Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.

Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1's is [1,1,1,1,1].

*/

export const longestSubarray = (nums: number[]) => {};

console.log(longestSubarray([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]));
