/*

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array
contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered
to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in (log n) time.

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

export const findPeakElement = (nums: number[]) => {
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;

  while (left < right) {
    let middle = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    if (nums[middle + 1] > nums[middle]) left = middle + 1;
    else if (nums[middle - 1] > nums[middle]) right = middle - 1;
    else return middle;
  }

  return left;
};

console.log(findPeakElement([1, 2]));
